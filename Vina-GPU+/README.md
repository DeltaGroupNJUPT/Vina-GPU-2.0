# Vina-GPU+
Vina-GPU+ further accelerates Vina-GPU and facilitates single receptor-multi-ligand docking.
## Compiling and Running
**Note**: at least one GPU card is required and make sure the version of GPU driver is up to date.
### Windows
#### Run on the executable file
1. For the first time to use Vina-GPU+, please run `Vina-GPU+_K.exe` with command `./Vina-GPU+_K.exe --config=./input_file_example/2bm2_config.txt`
You are supposed to have the docking results `test_out` file ,`Kernel1_Opt.bin` file and `Kernel2_Opt.bin` file
2. Once you have the `Kernel1_Opt.bin` file and `Kernel2_Opt.bin` file, you can run `Vina-GPU+.exe` without compiling the kernel files (thus to save more runtime)
>When you run `Vina-GPU+.exe`, please make sure `Kernel1_Opt.bin` file and `Kernel2_Opt.bin` file are in the same directory

For the usage and limitaiton of Vina-GPU+, please check [Usage](#Usage) and [Limitation](#Limitation).
A graphic user interface (GUI) is also provided for Windows users, please check [GUI](#GUI)
#### Build from source file
>Visual Studio 2019 is recommended for build Vina-GPU from source
1. install [boost library](https://www.boost.org/) (current version is 1.77.0)
2. install [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/zh-cn/cuda-toolkit) (current version is v11.5) if you are using NVIDIA GPU cards

    **Note**: the OpenCL library can be found in CUDA installation path for NVIDIA or in the driver installation path for AMD

3. add `./lib` `./OpenCL/inc` `$(YOUR_BOOST_LIBRARY_PATH)` `$(YOUR_BOOST_LIBRARY_PATH)/boost` `$(YOUR_CUDA_TOOLKIT_LIBRARY_PATH)/CUDA/v11.5/include` in the include directories
4. add `$(YOUR_BOOST_LIBRARY_PATH)/stage/lib` `$(YOUR_CUDA_TOOLKIT_PATH)/CUDA/lib/x64`in the addtional library 
5. add `OpenCL.lib` in the additional dependencies 
6. add `--config=./input_file_example/2bm2_config.txt` in the command arguments
7.  add `NVIDIA_PLATFORM` `OPENCL_3_0` `WINDOWS` in the preprocessor definitions if necessary
8. if you want to compile the binary kernel file on the fly, add `BUILD_KERNEL_FROM_SOURCE` in the preprocessor definitions
9. build & run
**Note**: ensure the line ending are CLRF

### Linux
**Note**: At least 8M stack size is needed. To change the stack size, use `ulimit -s 8192`.
1. install [boost library](https://www.boost.org/) (current version is 1.77.0)
2. install [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/zh-cn/cuda-toolkit) (current version is v11.5) if you are using NVIDIA GPU cards

    **Note**: OpenCL library can be usually in `/usr/local/cuda` (for NVIDIA GPU cards)
    
3. change the `BOOST_LIB_PATH` and `OPENCL_LIB_PATH` accordingly in `Makefile`
4. set GPU platform `GPU_PLATFORM` and OpenCL version `OPENCL_VERSION` in `Makefile`. some options are given below:

    **Note**: `-DOPENCL_3_0` is highly recommended in Linux, please avoid using `-OPENCL_1_2` in the Makefile setting. To check the OpenCL version on a given platform, use `clinfo`.
    |Macros|Options|Descriptions|
    |--|--|--|	
    |GPU_PLATFORM|-DNVIDIA_PLATFORM / -DAMD_PLATFORM|NVIDIA / AMD GPU platform
    |  OPENCL_VERSION | -DOPENCL_3_0 / -OPENCL_2_0|OpenCL version 3.0 / 2.0
    
5. type `make clean` and `make source` to build Vina-GPU+ that compile the kernel files on the fly (this would take some time at the first use)
7. after a successful compiling, `Vina-GPU+` can be seen in the directory 
8. type `./Vina-GPU+ --config ./input_file_example/2bm2_config.txt` to run Vina-GPU+
9. once you successfully run Vina-GPU+, its runtime can be further reduced by typing `make clean` and `make` to build it without compiling kernel files (but make sure the `Kernel1_Opt.bin` file and `Kernel2_Opt.bin` file is **unchanged**)
10. other compile options: 
  
|Options| Description|
|--|--|
| -g | debug|
|-DDISPLAY_ADDITION_INFO|print addition information
